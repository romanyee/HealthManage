        "血氧饱和度可以充分反映机体的氧合功能，血氧饱和度低的原因比较多，主要见于以下几方面：\n\n"
          "1、呼吸系统疾病，包括肺炎、支气管肺炎、支气管扩张、肺气肿、肺大泡、肺癌、气胸、胸腔积液、间质性肺炎、肺心病、肺纤维化等。\n\n"
          "2、心血管系统疾病，包括冠心病、不稳定性心绞痛、心肌梗死、心力衰竭、扩心病、先心病等。\n\n"
          "3、其他相关疾病，比如药物中毒、酮症酸中毒、乳酸酸中毒等。\n\n"
          "  出现血氧饱和度低时应积极完善相关检查，寻找原因，针对病因进行治疗。\n\n\n"
        "说明:\n"
        "一、什么是血氧饱和度?\n\n"
        "血氧饱和度(SpO2)是血液中氧气和血红蛋白结合的容量占全部血红蛋白容量的百分比，即血液中血氧的浓度，它是呼吸循环的重要生理参数。血氧饱和度低于90%，可能被认为是低血氧。设备血氧饱和度按如下方式划分，数值越低代表风险越高:\n\n"
        "正常：>=90%\n"
        "异常偏低：70%-89%\n\n"
        "二、血氧饱和度测量注意事项\n\n"
        "1.请在穿戴设备上启动血氧测量。为确保测量数据准确，请按佩戴指引操作。\n\n"
        "2.受某些外界因素(血流灌注低、手臂毛发多、有纹身、手臂下垂、手臂晃动、佩戴偏斜、低温等)影响，测量结果可能不准，甚至无法出结果。\n\n"
        "3.所提供的健康数据及建议仅供参考，不作为诊断和治疗依据。\n\n"

        "心率是指正常人安静状态下每分钟心跳的次数，也叫安静心率，-般为60 ~ 100次/分,可因年龄、性别或其他生理因素产生个体差异。- 般来说，年龄越小，心率越快，老年人心跳比年轻人慢，女性的心率比同龄男性快,这些都是正常的生理现象。安静状态下，成人正常心率为60 ~ 100次/分钟，理想心率应为55 ~ 70次/分钟(运动员的心率较普通成人偏慢，一般为50次/分钟左右) 。\n\n"

        "Material is the metaphor.\n\n"

        "A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion."
        "The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet "
        "technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.\n"
        "Surfaces and edges of the material provide visual cues that are grounded in reality. The "
        "use of familiar tactile attributes helps users quickly understand affordances. Yet the "
        "flexibility of the material creates new affordances that supercede those in the physical "
        "world, without breaking the rules of physics.\n"
        "The fundamentals of light, surface, and movement are key to conveying how objects move, "
        "interact, and exist in space and in relation to each other. Realistic lighting shows "
        "seams, divides space, and indicates moving parts.\n\n"

        "Bold, graphic, intentional.\n\n"

        "The foundational elements of print based design typography, grids, space, scale, color, "
        "and use of imagery guide visual treatments. These elements do far more than please the "
        "eye. They create hierarchy, meaning, and focus. Deliberate color choices, edge to edge "
        "imagery, large scale typography, and intentional white space create a bold and graphic "
        "interface that immerse the user in the experience.\n"
        "An emphasis on user actions makes core functionality immediately apparent and provides "
        "waypoints for the user.\n\n"

        "Motion provides meaning.\n\n"

        "Motion respects and reinforces the user as the prime mover. Primary user actions are "
        "inflection points that initiate motion, transforming the whole design.\n"
        "All action takes place in a single environment. Objects are presented to the user without "
        "breaking the continuity of experience even as they transform and reorganize.\n"
        "Motion is meaningful and appropriate, serving to focus attention and maintain continuity. "
        "Feedback is subtle yet clear. Transitions are efﬁcient yet coherent.\n\n"

        "3D world.\n\n"

        "The material environment is a 3D space, which means all objects have x, y, and z "
        "dimensions. The z-axis is perpendicularly aligned to the plane of the display, with the "
        "positive z-axis extending towards the viewer. Every sheet of material occupies a single "
        "position along the z-axis and has a standard 1dp thickness.\n"
        "On the web, the z-axis is used for layering and not for perspective. The 3D world is "
        "emulated by manipulating the y-axis.\n\n"

        "Light and shadow.\n\n"

        "Within the material environment, virtual lights illuminate the scene. Key lights create "
        "directional shadows, while ambient light creates soft shadows from all angles.\n"
        "Shadows in the material environment are cast by these two light sources. In Android "
        "development, shadows occur when light sources are blocked by sheets of material at "
        "various positions along the z-axis. On the web, shadows are depicted by manipulating the "
        "y-axis only. The following example shows the card with a height of 6dp.\n\n"

        "Resting elevation.\n\n"

        "All material objects, regardless of size, have a resting elevation, or default elevation "
        "that does not change. If an object changes elevation, it should return to its resting "
        "elevation as soon as possible.\n\n"

        "Component elevations.\n\n"

        "The resting elevation for a component type is consistent across apps (e.g., FAB elevation "
        "does not vary from 6dp in one app to 16dp in another app).\n"
        "Components may have different resting elevations across platforms, depending on the depth "
        "of the environment (e.g., TV has a greater depth than mobile or desktop).\n\n"

        "Responsive elevation and dynamic elevation offsets.\n\n"

        "Some component types have responsive elevation, meaning they change elevation in response "
        "to user input (e.g., normal, focused, and pressed) or system events. These elevation "
        "changes are consistently implemented using dynamic elevation offsets.\n"
        "Dynamic elevation offsets are the goal elevation that a component moves towards, relative "
        "to the component’s resting state. They ensure that elevation changes are consistent "
        "across actions and component types. For example, all components that lift on press have "
        "the same elevation change relative to their resting elevation.\n"
        "Once the input event is completed or cancelled, the component will return to its resting "
        "elevation.\n\n"

        "Avoiding elevation interference.\n\n"

        "Components with responsive elevations may encounter other components as they move between "
        "their resting elevations and dynamic elevation offsets. Because material cannot pass "
        "through other material, components avoid interfering with one another any number of ways, "
        "whether on a per component basis or using the entire app layout.\n"
        "On a component level, components can move or be removed before they cause interference. "
        "For example, a floating action button (FAB) can disappear or move off screen before a "
        "user picks up a card, or it can move if a snackbar appears.\n"
        "On the layout level, design your app layout to minimize opportunities for interference. "
        "For example, position the FAB to one side of stream of a cards so the FAB won’t interfere "
        "when a user tries to pick up one of cards.\n\n"
